# :package: RATS - Builds & Exports
This page contains all of the exports used for RATS and future versions.<br>
Some of these may be a little broken, but it should be resolved shortly.
> [!NOTE]
> Some exports lack page branding options for the site itself. _(Too complicated to code. Not worth it.)_

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Exports before V3 will not work.

## :card_file_box: Download Instructions
### :file_folder: HTML Exports:
Just download and open the file with your browser. _(Should be the default option for .html files.)_<br>
Viewing it as a text file ain't gonna do a thing.

### :bookmark: Bookmarklet Exports:
Open the file on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and copy all of it's contents _(Click Text, `Ctrl+A`, `Ctrl+C`)_<br>
Go to your Bookmarks Bar and paste the contents. _**(Make sure to rename it so you don't lose it!)**_<br>
> For Chrome, `Right Click` -> `Paste/Ctrl+V`.<br>
> Alternatively, `Right Click` -> `Add Page` -> `URL` -> `Paste/Ctrl+V`.

> [!NOTE]
> You have to be on a page that allows Inspect Element to use. _(For example, [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/) will not work!)_<br>
> Your browser's homepage also doesn't work.<br>
> Device pages, such as `chrome://new-tab`, also do not work.

### :card_index: Data Exports
Same as the Bookmarklet Exports, but instead you can paste it directly into the Search Bar.<br>
Use `Ctrl+D` to bookmark it.
> [!NOTE]
> Unlike Bookmarklets, any page will work with these. They overwrite it.
